The gradle-wrapper.jar file is a special binary executable that ensures all developers and CI systems use a consistent version of Gradle for building the project.

This file should be obtained from the official Gradle distribution and should not be modified.

Current version: Gradle 8.2

The wrapper JAR works in conjunction with:
- gradle-wrapper.properties - Contains configuration like distributionUrl
- gradlew script - Shell script for Unix systems
- gradlew.bat - Batch script for Windows systems

Do not modify this binary file. If you need to upgrade Gradle:
1. Update the version in gradle-wrapper.properties
2. Run: ./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version <new_version>
